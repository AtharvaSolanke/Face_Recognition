Hey,

To run the program just put it in your code editor and also download the faces folder with example faces.

If there is an error in starting 20 lines then it is because of the face location.
to solve the error : download the example faces -> right click on 1st face file -> click on copy path -> paste the path in face location in line 12 and and same for 2nd face file and pase it into face loction in line 16.

You can add n number of faces by copying image_bill and imgEncoding_bill variable with definations and paste it after 2nd face encoding and upgrade the code accordingly.

This is a basic code and suggestions/feedbacks are appreciated.

Thank You.

Atharva Solanke.
